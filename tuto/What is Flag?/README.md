## Description
The main idea behind almost all CTFs is to find the flag (CTF stands for Capture the Flag) faster than your opponents. The flag is a string in a specific format. In this CTF, the flag format is CCC{...}.

To complete the task, copy this flag: CCC{flag_example} into the field below.

(Easy, right? :D)

## Solution
Just copy-paste flag from description

---
The flag is: `CCC{fl4g_ex4mpl3}`
